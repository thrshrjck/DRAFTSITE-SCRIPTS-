                <h1>A Man Called Hurt - Draft</h1>
                <p>What started out as a quick 15-minute video as a favor for a friend, ended up a star-studded, feature-length documentary that highlights the amazing and inspiring life of a legend.

                    A Man Called Hurt chronicles the life and influence of Mississippi John Hurt on the music world. Featuring interviews from Mary Frances Hurt, John Sebastian of The Loving Spoonful, Happy Traum, Guy Davis, Dom Flemons, and others, our hope with this film is not only to educate the world about the impact of this fascinating man, but also to raise money for the Mississippi John Hurt Foundation.</p>

                <h1>American Made - Draft</h1>
                <p>A true passion project, American Made originated during 2020 under the confines of the pandemic. Draft was getting restless and needed a good story to tell. We stumbled upon Marcus Hall when we heard he was manufacturing some comfortable face masks — which were not easy to find during the thick of things. Upon visiting his store and meeting him, we left with a captivating story, a new sense of inspiration, and some damn fine masks.

                    American Made tells the story of Marcus Hall and his rise from the projects, his fall from grace, and his climb out of public shame.  </p>

                <h1>Actions Speak - Protomet</h1>
                <p>To keep up with the high demands for their engineering resources and premium boat components, Protomet needed more employees. Enter Draft. We created a recruitment video that simply tells the truth. Protomet is known as the secret weapon of the world’s best boat companies. With state-of-the-art equipment, great engineering minds, and the hardest working people we’ve ever seen, it was easy to create a piece that would make anyone want to be a part of the Protomet team.

                <h1>Welcome Home - Clayton</h1>
                <p>Clayton is a longtime, cherished client of Draft’s. Our journey with them has resulted in documentaries, brand films, comedy, and clever social campaigns. However, for their 2019 fall retail campaign, we decided to take them in a new direction. We created a sentimental, yet “real” approach that celebrates what it means to actually build a life in a Clayton Home.</p>

                <h1>Garden of Speed - Barber Motorsports Park & Museum</h1>
                <p>Built by George Barber in 2003, Barber Motorsports Park and Museum is considered the largest philanthropic project taken on by an individual in the history of Alabama. So, when their 20th anniversary came around, they called on Draft to create a cinematic short film that tells the story of how the museum and park came to be, and how it not only is preserving the past, but remains on the cutting edge of innovation and design in the motorsports world.</p>

                <h1>Tempo - Clayton</h1>
                <p>The “Tempo” is one of Clayton’s most exciting home models yet – a home that finds the perfect balance of style, function, affordability, and availability. And when Clayton’s retail team approached Draft for some marketing concepts, the idea was right in front of us: Tempo. This spot needs to revolve around music, dancing, and stylized graphics to show off the modern features of this impressive home.</p>
